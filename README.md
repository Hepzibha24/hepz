# 📊 Telco Customer Churn – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project on the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**.
The goal is to clean, preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover patterns that may explain **customer churn behavior**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies.
This project performs **data cleaning, outlier treatment, feature encoding, scaling, and visualization** to prepare the dataset for further modeling.

Key steps performed in the notebook:

### 1️⃣ **Importing Libraries**

* `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
* `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` – Data normalization

### 2️⃣ **Data Loading**

* Dataset is loaded using `pd.read_csv()`
* Previewed using `.head()`, `.shape()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`

### 3️⃣ **Data Cleaning**

* Removed **duplicate rows**
* Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric & handled missing values
* Treated **outliers** using IQR method

### 4️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* **Boxplots** for numerical features
* **Distribution plots** for `MonthlyCharges`
* **Count plots** for target variable `Churn`
* **Pairplots** and **correlation heatmap** for feature relationships

### 5️⃣ **Feature Engineering**

* Normalized numerical columns using `StandardScaler`
* Encoded categorical variables using `pd.get_dummies()`

## 📊 Visualizations

Some key visualizations include:

* **Boxplots** (before & after outlier treatment)
* **Distribution plots** for charges
* **Countplots** for churn distribution
* **Heatmap** for correlation analysis

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

2. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** (badge provided in notebook) or locally using Jupyter Notebook.

3. Install dependencies (if running locally):

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

4. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## 📈 Next Steps

This EDA provides a strong foundation for:

* **Predictive Modeling** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
* **Customer Segmentation**
* **Business Insights** to reduce churn rate
